# SQL-Project-for-Data-Analysis-using-Oracle-Database
What is the Agenda of the project?
The project’s Agenda involves Analyzing the data using SQL on the Oracle Database Software. We
first download the Oracle Database 21c edition from the official Oracle website and understand the
problem. Then a Password is set up for the “SYSTEM” username during the setup of Oracle Database
21c software. Then SQL Plus is used to connect to Oracle Database using the same credentials of the
Oracle Database 21c.
Further, a Database connection is established from SQL Developer to the Oracle Database using the
“SYSTEM” username and the password. Then tables are created in the database followed by data
insertion into tables and exploration, i.e., noticing relationships between tables, walking through the
columns, and seeing comments. Records are displayed in an ordered manner, handling NULL values,
and selecting records based on patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc. Then working on Data
Manipulation commands(DML) for Data Analysis. Then taking Backup of the Table where migration is
going on and use COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands. Then listing down distinct records, further
renaming columns, and finally, listing down employee details based on the complex nested
conditions.

● Creating tables and Inserting data into them
● Exploring tables and understanding the relationship between them
● Listing Employees and Departments based on some conditions
● Displaying records in an ordered manner using DESC keyword
● Handling NULL values and understanding them
● Selecting records based on some patterns like operators etc
● Working on DML commands for analysis
● Creating a backup of the table where migration is going on
● Executing COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands
● Listing DISTINCT records for analysis● Renaming the column for better analysis
● Listing down employee details based on complex nested conditions
Data Analysis:
● The Oracle Database 21c is downloaded from the Oracle website for SQL Data analysis.
● The SQL Developer is downloaded for working in Oracle databases, connecting it to the
“SYSTEM” username and creating tables in the database.
● Data is inserted into the tables, followed by the exploration of the tables, including a
walkthrough of columns and seeing comments.
● The listing of the Employees and Departments is done based on some conditions using the
SQL commands followed by displaying the records in an ordered manner and handling of the
NULL values.
● The selection of the records is made based on some patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc
followed by implementation of the Data Manipulation commands(DML) like Add, Update and
Delete for the Data Analysis.
● The backup of the table where migration is going on is taken, followed by COMMIT and
ROLLBACK commands. Then the listing of distinct records is done, and further renaming of
the columns.
● Finally, a listing of the employee details based on the complex nested conditions is done
